The most common errors:
- TS4.1 : The build number, where the error occured - 2, 4, 7, 9
- TS4.2 : The build number, where the error occured - 7, 8, 9
- TS4.4 : The build number, where the error occured - 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- TS4.5 : The build number, where the error occured - 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- TS5.1 : The build number, where the error occured - 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9

Used variables for testing (in pairs looking from a column perspective, the empty spaces mean ' '):
firstNumber  = 8; 8;   8;
secondNumber = 3;  ;   2;
firstSymbol  = C;  ; &$@;
secondSymbol = P; P;   P;

Considering all of the combined tests the only build that I was not able to break is number 5.

In the Prototype build the 'Divide by zero!' error breaks the calculator page and the only way to continue using the calculator
is either to refresh the browser, or to change the build.
I considered this fact as a 'feature' and wrote testing procedures accordingly.
